# Simple Rust Calculator

This is a basic calculator project written in Rust. It provides functionalities such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo operation, and power calculation. It is designed to receive input in the form of integers, and it handles basic error scenarios related to incorrect or unsupported mathematical operations.

## Project Files

This project includes the following two main Rust files:

- `main.rs`: The main file which uses the `calculate` function from the `calculator` module. Here, we define the two numbers and the operator for the calculation, and print the result to the console.

- `calculator.rs`: This file contains the calculator logic, including the `calculate` function and individual functions for each mathematical operation.

## How to Run the Project

To run this project, navigate to the directory containing the `.rs` files in your terminal and run the following command:

```
cargo run
```

This command will compile and run the Rust project, printing the result of the defined calculation to the console.
